Using JSON config (e.g., for OpenAI clients)

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Knit": {
      "url": "https://mcp.getknit.dev/agents/<your-server-id>/sse",
      "auth": {
        "header": "Authorization",
        "token": "<YOUR_SERVER_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


Or run via CLI (example for Claude Remote)

```
mcp-remote \
  --url https://mcp.getknit.dev/agents/<your-server-id>/sse \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_SERVER_TOKEN>"
```

Once connected, your AI will see defined tools and can start invoking them (e.g., getEmployee, createInvoice).
